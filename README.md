# Coolstr

coolstr is just a tiny function which can calculate how many different words are there in a string.

it would be easy to cut a sentense by space and line wrap, but it is difficult to decide whether the word you cut out is the same as the former one. Inside the coolstr I try to add several lambda function and implement some kind of 'format' feature. With these lambda we can translate the 'format rules' in code and search it in word map correctly.
